            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. Here, you can learn more about me, explore my projects, and get in touch. I apologize that this website is currently in the works. I also do not have much history on my Github account because the other one is tied to my Stony Brook email.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Here are some of my projects done in class. I have done projects in CSE316, CSE416, and CSE356.</p>
            <p>In CSE316 Fundamnents of Software Development, I worked with a partner (in a team of 2) on a project using the MERN stack and simulated a clone of the Stack Overflow website where users could create accounts, ask questions, post answers, and add comments as a user of the website. Data was stored in using Node.js and a MongoDB database. This was all done locally.</p>
            <p>In CSE416 Software Engineering, I worked in a team of 4 on a project that attempted to demonstrate the difference in in ethnic fairness between the state redistricting borders of preclearance, and non-preclearance states. The states that my team specifically worked on were New York (preclearance) and South Carolina (non-preclearance). We used similar technologies as in CSE316, however we used a Spring Framework (Java) in order to connect with the MongoDB database rather than Node.js this time. Each of us 4 had a different role: Client, Server, Preprocessing, and Data Processing. I had to closely work with the preprocessing partner in order to get the right data to process and the server partner to make sure the data was stored in a proper format so that it could be displayed correctly visually on the client. I used Python and an MGGG library in order to proesss the GIS data.</p>
